# Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct


Meet Qwen3-VL ‚Äî the most powerful vision-language model in the Qwen series to date.

This generation delivers comprehensive upgrades across the board: superior text understanding & generation, deeper visual perception & reasoning, extended context length, enhanced spatial and video dynamics comprehension, and stronger agent interaction capabilities.

Available in Dense and MoE architectures that scale from edge to cloud, with Instruct and reasoning‚Äëenhanced Thinking editions for flexible, on‚Äëdemand deployment.


#### Key Enhancements:

* **Visual Agent**: Operates PC/mobile GUIs‚Äîrecognizes elements, understands functions, invokes tools, completes tasks.

* **Visual Coding Boost**: Generates Draw.io/HTML/CSS/JS from images/videos.

* **Advanced Spatial Perception**: Judges object positions, viewpoints, and occlusions; provides stronger 2D grounding and enables 3D grounding for spatial reasoning and embodied AI.

* **Long Context & Video Understanding**: Native 256K context, expandable to 1M; handles books and hours-long video with full recall and second-level indexing.

* **Enhanced Multimodal Reasoning**: Excels in STEM/Math‚Äîcausal analysis and logical, evidence-based answers.

* **Upgraded Visual Recognition**: Broader, higher-quality pretraining is able to ‚Äúrecognize everything‚Äù‚Äîcelebrities, anime, products, landmarks, flora/fauna, etc.

* **Expanded OCR**: Supports 32 languages (up from 19); robust in low light, blur, and tilt; better with rare/ancient characters and jargon; improved long-document structure parsing.

* **Text Understanding on par with pure LLMs**: Seamless text‚Äìvision fusion for lossless, unified comprehension.

<p>


1. **Interleaved-MRoPE**: Full‚Äëfrequency allocation over time, width, and height via robust positional embeddings, enhancing long‚Äëhorizon video reasoning.

2. **DeepStack**: Fuses multi‚Äëlevel ViT features to capture fine‚Äëgrained details and sharpen image‚Äìtext alignment.

3. **Text‚ÄìTimestamp Alignment:** Moves beyond T‚ÄëRoPE to precise, timestamp‚Äëgrounded event localization for stronger video temporal modeling.

## Quickstart

Below, we provide simple examples to show how to use Qwen3-VL with ü§ñ ModelScope and ü§ó Transformers.

The code of Qwen3-VL has been in the latest Hugging Face transformers and we advise you to build from source with command:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
# pip install transformers==4.57.0 # currently, V4.57.0 is not released
```

### Using ü§ó Transformers to Chat

Here we show a code snippet to show how to use the chat model with `transformers`:

```python
from transformers import Qwen3VLForConditionalGeneration, AutoProcessor

# default: Load the model on the available device(s)
model = Qwen3VLForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct", dtype="auto", device_map="auto"
)

# We recommend enabling flash_attention_2 for better acceleration and memory saving, especially in multi-image and video scenarios.
# model = Qwen3VLForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
#     "Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct",
#     dtype=torch.bfloat16,
#     attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",
#     device_map="auto",
# )

processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct")

messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "image",
                "image": "https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-VL/assets/demo.jpeg",
            },
            {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image."},
        ],
    }
]

# Preparation for inference
inputs = processor.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=True,
    add_generation_prompt=True,
    return_dict=True,
    return_tensors="pt"
)

# Inference: Generation of the output
generated_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=128)
generated_ids_trimmed = [
    out_ids[len(in_ids) :] for in_ids, out_ids in zip(inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
]
output_text = processor.batch_decode(
    generated_ids_trimmed, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False
)
print(output_text)
```
